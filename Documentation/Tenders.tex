	\subsubsection{What makes you want to do the project}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item EpiUse (Electronic Voting):\\
			This project seems extremely interesting to me as it has to be secure. Security has always interested me and by using the block chain method to prevent tampering sounds like a great challenge that i look forward to.
		\item Retro Rabit (Insurance Profiling):\\
			Most people are extremely active on their social media (especially on Facebook). This project seemed particularly interesting as it gathers information from a source where the customer willingly gives all of this information without feeling obligated to do so.
		\item BVG Crop thing:\\
			Would like to work on algorithms to crunch existing data to predict future data. The agricultural community is currently struggling because of the drought and most produce has to be imported. Shops like spar apologized for the produce not being up to standard but they would like to still support local farmers

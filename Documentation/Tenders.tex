	EPI-USE one:
	
	I find the concept of Bitcoin and the implementation of Blockchain fascinating. The possibilities with regards to this concept is endless and I look forward to learning more about the implementation of software based on Blockchain and the use of peer-to-peer implementations in general.
	
	Insurance blah blah:
	
	Social media has seen a huge growth in the last 5 years and developing a system based on this form of media is fascinating and can lead to some interesting application.
	
	Crop:
	
	Agriculture contributes significantly to our daily lives and the ability to predict scenarios that might allow us to foresee damages will in the end result in a sustainable future. I believe the development of these stress-testing algorithms can combat unforeseen damages.

	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{What makes you want to do the project}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item EpiUse (Electronic Voting):\\
			This project seems extremely interesting to me as it has to be secure. Security has always interested me and by using the block chain method to prevent tampering sounds like a great challenge that i look forward to.
		\item Retro Rabit (Insurance Profiling):\\
			Most people are extremely active on their social media (especially on Facebook). This project seemed particularly interesting as it gathers information from a source where the customer willingly gives all of this information without feeling obligated to do so.
		\item BVG Crop thing:\\
			Would like to work on algorithms to crunch existing data to predict future data. The agricultural community is currently struggling because of the drought and most produce has to be imported. Shops like spar apologized for the produce not being up to standard but they would like to still support local farmers

	\subsubsection{Development Methodology}
	We intend to follow the Agile Development strategy as recommended by the client. Agile allows incremental integration and development, to foresee any problems which might arise. The developmental cycle of the methodology is divided into "sprints", at the end of each sprint a working model is expected. Through iterative revision for each lifecycle (Planning, Development, Testing, Deploying), any problems or changes to the direction of the project can be implemented in the next sprint. An example includes a bi-weekly meetings with the client, the overall goal might change, as a result agile caters for the future implementation and changes.
	
	\subsubsection{How you are going to keep the client informed about the status of your project.}
	As per the client project proposal weekly or bi-weekly meetings will be held to "promote good and
healthy software engineering practices". These meetings will provide progress updates to the client and give insight on what is expected at the end of our next sprint and what goals need be achieved. 
	
	\subsubsection{Possibly any initial ideas you have around solving some of the technical challenges.}
	As a starting point we will research the Facebook API which is used for data gathering, as this forms a critical part of the project. We will meet with the client's expert to establish what qualitative information might further be used in the fine-tuning of a risk profile.
	
	\subsubsection{Technologies}
	Since the project requires a front-end, Facebook scraper and engine, we will use a variety of web based languages and technologies including (but not limited to): PHP, Javascript, HTML5, AngularJS (or EmberJS) or possibly a larger framework such as Django. Depending on the web-framework used we will determine the database system to use. 
	
	\subsubsection{Client will receive}
	As per the project proposal document the client will receive:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Documented source code
		\item Test code and scripts
		\item Architectural designs
		\item A user manual
		\item Build and deploy scripts
	\end{itemize}
	Any deliverables required that is not mentioned in the project proposal will be provided as per request.\\
	
	We look forward to developing a project for Retro Rabbit as this is a great opportunity to further our  careers in the technology industry.
